## Inspiration
I have faced this issue a lot that I got some wacky idea but got lazy and slept on it only to forget it forever💀. Only to ponder over and over again to no avail. One such thing when I working on my course project of "Computer Graphics" (iykyk) and had spent an entire week optimising my code but it still took 3min to run. Then, after my daily exercise, I got an idea for implementing the optimised version but then, my cousins came. I did scribble it on a paper but I forgot the jist of it. I did found the piece again after 2 days of hitting my head on the wall. My friends also agree to have faced this issue.<br>
One thing, I did remember that day though, that if there was an application that could convert <b>THOUGHT TO CODE </b> with a test case then, my problem wouldn't have occured.
## What it does
Like my problem explained above. You give it 3 prompts: Task, Input and Expected Output and the application processes it to build you a verified piece of code that fulfills your needs. Verified? Yup the code that is given is run and checked basis the original format to make it a perfect match for the users needs.
## How we built it
I have been intesreted in AI for a while and have been a fan of LLMs. I referred to 2 research papers before solidifying my idea and implementing it.<br>
These two papers were [Agent CODER](https://arxiv.org/html/2312.13010v2) and [Tree of Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10601). I had gone through others like DynaMOSA for dynamic test case generation but left it owing to the time constraint. So, to understand my implementation its necessary to view these two.<br>

Applies the idea of chain of thought prmopting. It has 3 agents (LLMs/automations) one to write code, one for testcases and one to verify the authenicity combination. While, the idea seems correct there is a flaw that is if either one of the units were to perform incorrectly then, results won't be useful.<br>
If both were to wrong in the same manner then, too incorrect code is generated.

<B> Tree of Thought</B>
In chain of thought the focus is to break one problem into several simpler ones. Tree of Thought takes it up a notch by exploring different reasoning branches(since LLMs are inconsisent it helps to try different ideas). For each reasoning branch one core idea wrong/right is applied throughout like in a Depth First Search manner.<br>
